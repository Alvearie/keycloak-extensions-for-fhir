## Contributing
This repository is provided as a sample and is not yet accepting contributions.
In the near future, we hope to clear the necessary legalese to accept contributions so that this repository
can fulfil its purpose as a community effort for Keycloak practitioners in health IT.

## Future planning
Once we are clear to accept external contributions, we plan to use the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/DCO1.1.txt) to ensure good pedigree.

All contributors must provide a [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/DCO1.1.txt) sign-off for each commit, so please read the text of the DCO and add a line like the following to the end of each commit message:
```
Signed-off-by: Author Name <author.email@example.com>
```

Hint:  git will add this line automatically if you pass the `-s` (`--signoff`) flag to your git commit.

The repository has been configured with the [DCO bot](https://github.com/probot/dco), which ensures that
all contributions are "signed off" before they are be merged.

### Merge approval

All changes to the `main` branch must be approved by one or more project maintainer.

For a list of project maintainers, see the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) page.
We are always looking for additional maintainers, so please contact us if you are interest in helping to drive the project forward.
