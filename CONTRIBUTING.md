## Legal

### Copyright
Each source file should include a copyright statement and must include a link to the Apache
Software License 2.0. Using the SPDX format is the simplest approach:

```
/*
(C) Copyright <your name or company name here> 2021

SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
*/
```

Or, if modifying an existing file:
```
/*
(C) Copyright <original copyright holder> and others 2021

SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
*/
```

### Developer's Certificate of Origin
We use the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/DCO1.1.txt)
to maintain project pedigree.

We ask that, when submitting a patch for review, the developer include a sign-off to certify that:
```
       (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by them and they
           have the right to submit it under the open source license
           indicated in the file; or
       (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
           of their knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
           license and they have the right under that license to submit that
           work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
           by them, under the same open source license (unless they are
           permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
           in the file; or
       (c) The contribution was provided directly to them by some other
           person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and they have not modified
           it.
       (d) They understand and agree that this project and the contribution
           are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
           personal information they submit with it, including their sign-off) is
           maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
           this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

Here is an example Signed-off-by line:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your
local git repository using the following command:

```
git commit -s
```

### Merge approval
All changes to the `main` branch must be approved by one or more project maintainer.

For a list of project maintainers, see the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) page.
We are always looking for additional maintainers, so please contact us if you are interest in helping to drive the project forward.
